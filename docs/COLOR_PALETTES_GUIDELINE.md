# Color Palettes Guideline

**Unified Palette Standards for UI and Pixel Art**

---

## 1. **Purpose of Color Palettes**

To ensure a consistent aesthetic and enhance usability, this guideline standardizes color selection across all visual elements, including pixel art and UI. Each palette should support readability, contrast, and harmony in both functional and aesthetic components.

---

## 2. **Color Palette Structure**

Each palette should include the following:

- **Primary Colors**: Dominant colors that define the main visual tone.
- **Secondary Colors**: Used for accents or to complement primary colors.
- **Neutral Colors**: Backgrounds, borders, shadows, and support text. Include a range of light to dark neutrals.
- **Highlight/Action Colors**: Indicate interactive elements or alerts (e.g., buttons, notifications).
- **Shadow and Shading Variants**: Tints and shades for 3D effects, depth, and texture.

---

## 3. **General Guidelines**

- **Limited Colors**: Aim to use 8-12 colors per palette. This keeps visuals cohesive and prevents overcrowding.
- **Hue Shifting for Depth**: Adjust hues slightly for shading and highlights rather than pure black or white to add vibrancy and natural lighting.
- **Contrast Ratios**: Ensure sufficient contrast between foreground and background elements for readability.

---

## 4. **Primary Palette Standards**

**UI Elements**  
  - **Buttons**: Use primary colors for important actions (e.g., calls to action) with a hover or active state variant.
  - **Backgrounds**: Use softer, desaturated versions of the primary colors for larger background areas to reduce visual strain.
  - **Text and Icons**: Prioritize high contrast to ensure readability; for dark themes, use light neutrals, and vice versa.

**Pixel Art Elements**  
  - **Main Color**: Use for base textures and large areas of the sprite or environment.
  - **Outline**: If outlining is needed, use a slightly darker shade of the main color to avoid harsh edges.
  - **Shadows and Highlights**: Apply lighter and darker tones of the main color to indicate depth and form.

---

## 5. **Secondary Palette Standards**

**UI Elements**  
  - **Accent Colors**: Use sparingly for items like notifications, badges, or indicators to draw attention without overwhelming the design.
  - **Secondary Buttons**: Differentiate secondary actions with subtle shifts in hue or saturation.

**Pixel Art Elements**  
  - **Detailing**: Use secondary colors for adding finer details to objects, enhancing textures, or creating patterns.
  - **Variations**: When creating variations of the same object, rely on secondary colors to add diversity without altering the primary palette.

---

## 6. **Neutral Palette Standards**

- **Usage Across Both UI and Art**: Use neutrals for backgrounds, low-contrast elements, and to soften the appearance of brighter colors.
- **Value Range**: Include a range of light, medium, and dark neutrals to support dynamic shading and depth without introducing additional colors.

---

## 7. **Highlight and Action Colors**

**Alert Colors**  
  - Use colors like red or yellow for warnings, errors, or high-priority notifications. 
  - Keep these colors consistent across UI and art for immediate recognition.

**Selection and Interaction**  
  - Use a noticeable but not overpowering color (e.g., blue or green) for interactive or selected elements.
  - Ensure these colors complement primary and secondary choices and harmonize across UI and pixel art assets.

---

## 8. **Applying Palettes for Cohesiveness**

- **UI and Pixel Art Harmony**: Both UI elements and pixel art should adhere to the chosen palette to create a unified style.
- **Testing Across Components**: Test color combinations in both UI mockups and in-game assets to ensure readability, consistency, and aesthetic appeal.

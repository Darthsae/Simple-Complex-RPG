**Style Guide for 32x32 Pixel Art (1m²) – Top-Down Perspective**

---

## Overview

This guide sets a consistent style for 32x32 pixel art assets in a top-down perspective, where each tile represents a 1-meter square. Maintaining uniformity in scale, color, shading, and details will help achieve a cohesive visual experience.

---

## 1. **Scale & Proportions**

- **Scale:** Each 32x32 pixel tile represents a 1m x 1m area.
- **Character Proportions:** Characters should fit comfortably within a 32x32 grid. Standard characters occupy roughly 24x24 pixels with room to allow for idle animations, rotation, or movement.
- **Object Size Reference:** Small items (e.g., rocks, plants) take up 1/4 to 1/2 of the tile. Large objects (e.g., trees, furniture) should stay within the 32x32 boundary, with subtle overlap for natural shapes if needed.

---

## 2. **Perspective**

- **Top-Down View**: Assets should be drawn from a bird’s-eye view, with subtle angling to reveal important details.
  - **Characters and Items:** Position key features facing slightly upward to improve recognizability.
  - **Environment Elements:** Flatten larger elements like ground textures, keeping minimal angles to avoid breaking the top-down illusion.

## 3. **Color Palette**

- **Limited Palette:** Aim for a limited color palette (8-12 colors per asset) to maintain visual clarity.
- **Hue Shifts:** Use hue shifts for shading instead of pure black or white to add depth and vibrancy.
- **Ambient Lighting:** Use soft colors for outdoor environments to convey natural daylight, or warmer/cooler tones based on indoor lighting.

---

## 4. **Shading & Highlights**

- **Light Source:** Consistent top-down light source, angled slightly to the top left. Shadows should fall bottom-right.
- **Shading Style:** Use 1-2 shadow tones and 1 highlight tone per color. Avoid excessive dithering; instead, use solid shading for clarity.
- **Outline:** Apply outlines selectively to key elements that need contrast. Consider using darker shades of the object’s color for internal outlines instead of black.

---

## 5. **Detailing and Textures**

- **Simplicity First:** Avoid adding excessive detail in each tile to keep visual clutter minimal.
- **Texture Suggestions:** Create texture for surfaces (e.g., grass, wood) using a few pixels in contrasting shades, preserving the shape and readability of objects.
- **Pixel Clarity:** Each pixel should contribute to the form and readability of the object. Avoid stray or single pixels that don’t enhance the design.

---

## 6. **Consistency Guidelines**

- **Object Sizes:** Keep similar objects proportionate to avoid scale inconsistencies.
- **Asset Variety:** When designing variants (e.g., different types of trees), follow consistent proportions and details so variations feel cohesive.
- **Repeating Patterns:** For textures or tiles meant to repeat (e.g., ground, floor tiles), make seamless transitions without obvious breaks.

---

## 7. **Animation Tips**

- **Frames:** For subtle animations (e.g., idle movements), aim for 2-4 frames to keep file size manageable.
- **Movement Guidelines:** Exaggerate pixel movement to create a sense of motion within the limited resolution.
- **Looping:** Ensure seamless looping for any animated assets to avoid jumpy transitions.
